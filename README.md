# Wine-Prediction
Welcome to **My Wine Quality Prediction App**, where science meets the art of wine tasting! 🍷 

Have you ever wondered what goes into determining the quality of a bottle of wine? Is it the perfect balance of acidity? The smoothness of sugar? Or perhaps the kick of alcohol? Well, now you can find out with the power of machine learning! 🎉

This app uses a **Random Forest Classifier**—a powerful machine learning model—to predict the quality of wine based on a variety of characteristics like fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, and more. By simply inputting the values of these key features, the app will predict a quality score for the wine on a scale from 0 to 10. 🌟

What makes it even cooler? You don’t need to be a wine expert to use it. Whether you're a casual wine lover or a budding sommelier, this app gives you an easy and interactive way to predict the quality of wine just by entering a few values. 🧑‍🍳

The app is built on real data from a popular wine dataset and uses a Random Forest model to make predictions. No need for tastings or blind guesses—just plug in the numbers and let the algorithm do its magic! ✨

So whether you're choosing a bottle for dinner, analyzing your favorite wines, or just having fun experimenting with different inputs, **My Wine Quality Prediction App** is your trusty assistant in the world of wine. 🥂 

Enjoy discovering your next great bottle of wine, and maybe even impress your friends with your newfound "scientific" wine knowledge! Cheers! 🍇
